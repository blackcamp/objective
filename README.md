# Project - Black Camp



## Why or What?

Yet again, **Myanmar** is soaking in blood due to **Terrorist Military** and **their peers**. The real chaos out there is there's no one to leads the whole revolution strategically. Terrorist Military created this situation by **making conflicts between states & races** since decades ago and kept going with it. Now people **fears** and **distrust** each other due to Military placing `Informants, Criminals, etc..` inside the cities & towns. Which breaks our Unity and less people getting involved, leading to more **tortures & deaths**. And **CRPH** has no power to protect people from unnecessary damages. We must understand that without proper **Unity & Strategy**, we can't win this revolution. To minimize the damage and effectively respond in emergence, we'll need to unify the people via reliable internet platform, rebuilding trust with a decentralized leadership. Educate people and eventually aims to become a platform that powers the people in Intelligence warfare.

## Mission

This project aims to **filter out** `Informants, Traitors, Murderers, Militants and those who supports them` by building an internet **Community** based on a set of rules sets by the community.

Our main goal is to provide:

- Identity verification for safer neighborhoods.
- A secure communication for more unity.
- More reliable information through verified News reporters.
- Plans & Strategies for safer defensive operations.
- Emergency weapon creation guides.




## The followings are the definitions & criteria for `Identity verification system`

The main idea is to distinguishing  `friends` or  `foes`. Although there's no perfect solution found yet, we can still differentiate them using **Referral or Guaranteed verification method** of the individual by another trusted individual. As accounted individual will be held responsible for the actions of referring individual's past, present and future, they'll be forced to verify only to those who are closest to them. That way a network will be filled with groups and groups of closest people. Eventually leaving out those who doesn't have close friends. People who doesn't have friends are generally seen as a red flag to the society, even so we believe people have their own reasons. Which is why these people can still verify themselves via **Self - Verification** ways listed at the bottom.
